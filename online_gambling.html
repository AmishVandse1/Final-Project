                Loot boxes are virtual items that can be redeemed to receive randomly selected other virtual items, and have been criticized for being similar to gambling. The presence of loot boxes in video games has dramatically increased since 2010, with little evidence available for the current prevalence rate of loot box purchasing in the general population, particularly during and following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. This study uses data from representative samples of American youth to estimate prevalence rates for video game play and loot box consumption before the pandemic (2019) and after the pandemic lockdowns (2022) to examine whether the pandemic has affected loot box usage in the general population and among gamers. The results suggest that youth loot box consumption has increased, rising from 24.9% in 2019 to 31.6% in 2022 among 8th grade (age 13–14) youth. The increase over this time period was larger for girls, though boys are still more likely to purchase loot boxes overall.

                The concept of loot boxes first originated from the loot systems developed in multiplayer online role-playing games and monetization of free-to-play mobile gaming, appearing between 2004 and 2007. Since then, it has become more prevalent in free-to-play games along with full-priced games, serving as the main revenue-generating tool for developers and companies while also providing the player-based with new content. However, their popularization in the mid-2010s led to heightened scrutiny, particularly exemplified by Star Wars Battlefront II, which introduced "pay-to-win" mechanics that heavily favored spending real money on loot boxes. Such practices drew criticism for their adverse effects on gameplay balance and anti-consumer implementations in fully-priced games, prompting discussions about the ethical boundaries between gaming and gambling and sparking research into their impact on children, youth, and families.            </div>

            Underage Gambling in Video Games

                The emergence of underage gambling in video games, fueled by the creation of loot boxes which began in the early 2010s, has proven to be a financial windfall for the video game industry, raking in billions of dollars. According to a report by Juniper Research, loot boxes bought with real-world currency generated a staggering $15 billion for the industry in 2020 alone. Like the gaming experience, purchasing loot boxes has varying participation across age demographics. A study by Brooks & Clark revealed that approximately sixty percent of underage gamers have engaged in purchasing loot boxes. In one of the top video games currently available, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the in-game skins for weapons created an entire gambling industry around its skins. In-game items can be wagered across hundreds of gambling sites, very similar to traditional gambling. In a report conducted by CS: GO Youtuber Houngoungagne, it was found that 70% of people who have gambled with CS: GO skins started when they were under 18, this include opening in-game loot boxes and using gambling sites. The prevalence of underage gambling in video games, particularly through the proliferation of loot boxes and in-game item gambling, underscores the urgent need for regulatory intervention. Despite the clear parallels between these mechanics and traditional forms of gambling, the gaming industry has largely operated without stringent oversight. This lack of regulation enables companies to exploit vulnerable demographics, such as minors, who may not fully comprehend the risks associated with gambling behavior.            </div>

                Recently the realm of video game gambling has targeted a different avenue to lure children, Twitch. Once one of the largest streamers on the platform, Tyler Niknam also known as Trainwrecks to his 1.5 million followers, would spend hours hitting slots on Stake.com, an online cryptocurrency casino. His gambling stream would amass a live audience of 25,000 viewers. He would constantly be winning, sometimes reaching into the millions, and would somehow never go broke. However, and unbeknown to the viewers, this wasn’t actually his money. In fact, Stake.com would sponsor him to gamble on their website, providing him the money to gamble and improving the odds for him to win. Many of his viewers are not of legal gambling age, yet they are exposed to constant promotions and advertisements for online casinos and betting sites. This exposure can desensitize them to the risks and consequences of gambling addiction, leading to potential financial ruin and mental health struggles later in life. Many of the top Twitch streamers such as xQc, Nickmercs, and Adin Ross would receive multimillion-dollar deals from Stake to promote their website. In response to growing concerns, there have been calls for stricter regulations and oversight regarding gambling content on platforms like Twitch. Implementing age restrictions, clearer disclosure requirements for sponsored content, and promoting responsible gambling practices are essential steps in mitigating the negative impact of gambling-related streams on young audiences. Additionally, fostering open discussions about the risks of gambling and providing support for those struggling with addiction are crucial in safeguarding the well-being of vulnerable individuals within the gaming community.
